# ecommerce-frontend

This application is intended to be a reusable AngularJS app for and ecommerce. As an example, I based my development in the famous HBO TV serie Game Of Thrones(GOT), but you can base your development in the theme you need implementing small modifications in the code.

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Build & development

This repository only consists of Frontend technologies and need to be used in combination with an API. Anyway, in case you don't have any API developed, you can use any of the multiple ecommerce online builders or use a small ecommerce API I developed (you can find it in this link: https://github.com/byJavimo/ecommerce-apirest)

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
